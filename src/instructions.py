    Welcome to Hack the Safe!

    PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU START:
        
    - The aim of the game is to unlock all the digits of the code to unlock the safe.
        
    - Once you start the game, you will be given a question to answer about python.
    
    - If you get a multiple choice question then type in the letter for the answer.
        
    - If you get the answer right then you will unlock a single digit of the code.
        
    - This continues until you have unlocked the whole code which will unlock the safe for you.
        
    - If you answer incorrectly three times then it is game over, so you get three tries.
        
    - You can play on Easy, Medium or Hard mode.
